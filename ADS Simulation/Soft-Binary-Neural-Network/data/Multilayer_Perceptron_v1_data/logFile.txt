Processing VAMS source 'D:/Reading/EE6347 Neuromorphic/CMOS Binary Neural Network/CMOS-Binary-Neural-Network/ADS Simulation/EE6347_wrk/EE6347_lib/rram/veriloga/veriloga.va'
 compiled source cache is valid
Analog module platform compile:
    [1] amswork.RRAM (valid object cache, no platform compile required)
    Analog module design library exists, no link required.
Done with exporting 160 VerilogA device(s).
    Matrix is singular (detected between nodes or branches `BL7' and `X108.Gap').
    Matrix is singular (detected at node or branch `X146.Gap').
The final solution did not converge while removing gnode,
 so we accept the solution with gnode = 1e-12


TRAN Tran1[1] <Soft-Binary-Neural-Network_lib:Multilayer_Perceptron_v1:schematic>   time=(0 s->34 ms)
    Matrix is singular (detected between nodes or branches `X14.Temp' and `X14.Gap').

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during TRAN analysis `Tran1'.
    A virtual resistance of 1 TOhms 
    was added between `X14.Temp' and ground.
