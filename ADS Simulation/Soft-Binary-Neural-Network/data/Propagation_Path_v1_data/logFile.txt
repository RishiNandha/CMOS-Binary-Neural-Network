 compiled source cache is valid
Analog module platform compile:
    [1] amswork.RRAM (valid object cache, no platform compile required)
    Analog module design library exists, no link required.
Done with exporting 2 VerilogA device(s).
    Matrix is singular (detected at node or branch `X1.Gap').
    Matrix is singular (detected at node or branch `X1.Gap').
The final solution did not converge while removing gnode,
 so we accept the solution with gnode = 1e-12
